<h3>About this app</h3>
<p>This Shiny app simplifies the labeling and rating process. Users can:
<ul>
  <li>Upload data files in .txt, .csv, or .xlsx format.</li>
  <li>Filter the dataset to only the rows that need labels or ratings.</li>
  <li>Specify constraints on the labels or ratings to be entered (e.g. only numbers within a certain range).</li>
  <li>View each item and enter a label/rating one at a time in a separate window. Each rating is automatically saved in the appropriate row of the dataframe.</li>
  <li>Add a note for each rating when needed.</li>
  <li>Download a new data file with new columns for ratings and any notes.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Alternative to rmcorr: Resources for multilevel modeling</h4>
<p>Mulitlevel modeling is a more complicated alternative to rmcorr, but multilevel modeling has capabilities that rmcorr does not. Multilevel modeling permits varying slopes whereas rmcorr <i>always</i> fits a common or fixed slope across participants.  We recommend using multilevel modeling if: there are more than two variables of interest (in addition to participants or subjects), data with more than two levels, simultaneous modeling of within and between-participants is needed, visual patterns patterns suggest varying slopes by individual and/or non-linear associations, and time need to be explicitly included in the model (i.e., modeling change over time as a separate variable. See the <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00456/full">Journal Article for rmcorr</a> and references below for more information.</p>
